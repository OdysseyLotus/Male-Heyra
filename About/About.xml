	<description>Adds male Heyra and male Rong.
	
Personally, alien mods that don't add males without any real reason in their lore always kinda bothered me. However, I am really interested in the Heyra the Horned mod, since it
seemed to add a lot of cool features. So, I decided to devote a couple of days to creating assets for male Heyra and Rong, which include their bodies and male versions of the
clothes. Keep in mind, however, that I am not an artist. I did not draw any original assets; rather, I edited preexisting assets to create these. So if something seems to look off,
that is why. I might edit things more in the future, but for now, here is the mod.

If there are any other alien races you want me to add males to, let me know and I might devote some time to creating those assets and patches as well.</description>
